         he would pick up a cricket bat, start swinging it and ask his father to bowl at him.<br>
<br>
  He was raised in Sri Ganganagar and started his schooling at Good Shepherd Public School. At the age of 15 he joined Cricket Academy and his father took him to the academy after their neighbours suggested that 
 "Gourav shouldn't waste his time in gully cricket and instead join a professional club" he was trained at the academy under his coach and also played matches
  at the district level in Rajasthan. He was ready to bat at any spot, and his father had to literally push him home after the training sessions. He just wouldn’t leave. Though his parents are really supportive ,He was not good at academics , As a result he choose to join some open school
  and after that he has completed his schooling from Nios.
  so that he can give more time to cricket.
